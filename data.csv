I am just wondering who is responsible for street/landscape maintenance along certain streets in the city and county that I travel often.  Along Smith Rd., just north of Hillside, there was a lot of brush that has been cut down but nothing else and an ugly partial fence is still standing.  The new roundabout at Sare Rd. and Rogers….who is responsible for maintaining the landscaping that was installed.  It is a bunch of weeds right now.  Along south Highland, just north of Rogers, there is a curve that is alway full of potholes and the street and sidewalk are a mess.  On Sare Rd., at the entrance to Hyde Park, who is responsible for a mess of grass clippings that is always left after the grass is allowed to grow very, very long.  It is still there.  Just some questions.  I tried to attach photos but I have not had success.  Thanks.   Debbie Kuratko","Street Department",,Bloomington,IN,,,

The eastbound Stop sign on Maxwell @ Highland, in Elm Heights, is OFTEN ignored. 

I have seen cars race right through it without even the pretense of slowing down. On foot, I have jumped out behind the car as it sped on, waving my hands and shouting ""STOP SIGN!!"", and once a driver waved an acknowledgment. Another time, driving north on Highland, I turned and followed the offender, honking and blinking my lights hoping s/he would notice that someone had noticed and be alert next time. 

The Stop sign is quite visible, not obscured by overhanging trees, so I am stumped. But I wonder if it could be moved closer to the road, enlarged, painted (the post too) a more neon/catchy red, and/or moved to the CENTER of the intersection (tricky for the snowplows, I know), and/or a ""Stop-sign alert"" sign added well before, or maybe it could be removed altogether with appropriate alerts posted for the north/south drivers, which might be safer than assuming people will stop.  This is a potentially lethal situation for drivers, bikers, and walkers in a very pedestrian-heavy neighborhood.

There are three Potholes between 4ft to 2 ft with 4~6 inch deep on the W. Leonard Springs Rd. between W Ison Rd & Hwy 45, there are on the right lane if you gone to the Hwy 45. There are becoming bigger every day, causing unsafely driving specially on the night, I hope they can be patched ASAP.

I couldn't get the mayor to comment directly on the following via the Ask the Mayor program on WFIU, perhaps your dept can comment?

Downtown and near downtown main streets are
 becoming a maze of hazardous patched sections,
uneven pavement, road projects without final paving (roundabout
at Arlington Road) and wear and tear that is not being attended
to. I have my doubts that the Street Dept is at fault here but here
is what I have observed as a lifelong resident who notices things.
Due to the recent explosion of downtown building, contractors tear up 
our downtown streets, often major thoroughfares in order to connect to 
utilities, etc. They further damage the street with huge pieces of machinery 
needed for the construction. They finish the project and then cheap out on 
really repairing the damage to the street that was often in fine condition 
prior to them tearing it up. Then all the citizens have is a street that will kill
 their tires, struts and rattle their teeth as well as possibly causing accidents. 
They leave it up to the city to spend the huge $$$ to really fix the road 
correctly. The contractors and builders have no right to destroy our streets 
that WE pay taxes to keep in excellent  condition. We should not have to 
wait for a scheduled road project when the road in question carries 
thousands of cars and other vehicles a day. This type of damage 
is very obvious at the northern apex of Walnut and College Avenues. 
Just patching the potholes and bumps and uneven surfaces is NOT enough.
It seems that the streets that are getting paved and kept in the best 
condition  in Bloomington are those who live in exclusive additions 
off these roads and all they had to do was to jiggle the ringer on the 
mayor’s cell phone and voila! the street is smooth as a baby’s bottom.
Could you comment on my observations and what can be done?",,,Bloomington,IN,,,

The repair work was OUTSTANDING, by the way! The promptness and quality of the repair work was spot-on ... many thanks to the City!  

However, after a few months we've noticed that the asphalt used for the repair appears to now be ""separating"" from the original pavement of the East edge of street (see attached photo). 

Our concern is that as winter approaches, there will be opportunities for water/snow/ice to accumulate, freeze, and actually cause *more* damage to the original repair work.  

Can we please request to have the City come check out this repair work to see if it needs additional work?  Thank you so much in advance!

I live at 1300 East Maxwell Lane on the SE corner of E. Maxwell Lane and Highland Avenue.  Several weeks ago I contacted you about a hole in the pavement that runs in front of out house.  It is situated in an offset parking area that looks to be on the easement along the front of our house.  The hole is about 8 inches across and several inches deep.  Below the surface of the pavement you can see the top of a pipe which extends north towards an open drainage area at the intersection of East Maxwell Lane and Highland. It would seem to continue to the south down Highland.  You can see the edge of the pipe, which is open, where the hole in the pavement has formed and it looks as though water must have been draining out at this point causing the surrounding material around it to erode which allowed the pavement above it to collapse.  

Several days after I contacted you someone from the city did come out and look at it but  said that he was not sure as to whether it was the city’s responsibility to correct the problem or ours as the homeowners.  He said he would need to research the situation to see exactly what might be involved in the problem and who should take care of the repair.  However we have not heard anything from the city concerning this and we would like to have it corrected before winter sets in with more rain and snow runoff creating more of a problem, which I feel sure will ultimately affect not only our lot but also the street adjacent to it.

A few days after that person was here I did see a city car pulled up alongside Maxwell Lane for a few minutes but no one got out or came to the door to inquire but it could have been someone else from the city coming to assess the situation.  They may have been thinking that the problem was on that side of the house since we do have a Maxwell Lane address but the house faces Highland and the problem is on that side.  I don’t know, this is just a guess.   

Could someone there please check to see what is happening with this problem?","Utilities Engineering",,Bloomington,IN,,,

Hello, my name is Jenee' Trimble and I manage an apartment building on the corner of 6th and Washington.  When the parking meters were first installed, the City accidentally added an extra parking space.  That space happens to be right in front of my building.  To correct the error, the white stripe that marked the parking lane was covered with black paint to blend in with the pavement, and the curb painted yellow.  The black paint has since worn off, exposing the white line again.  This has caused confusion, and although there is a yellow curb, people identify it as a parking space due to the white lines and mistakingly park there often. I have notified the parking department of this error for over a year.  Recently, I had a 17 year old girl from Nashville Indiana doing some painting at my building.  She parked in that spot by mistake.  I have tried to appeal the $20 ticket, but the parking department has refused to waive it.  Instead I was sent the City ordinance that addresses yellow curbs.  I understand that you can't park where there is a yellow curb, but nowhere else in the city is there a yellow curb that is also marked with white lines, identifying the space for parking.  The city ordinance defining a designated parking space is as follows: 15.04.090- ""parking space"" means any space that is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by lines painted or marked on the curb or surface of the street .  The space is clearly marked with a white line.  The line shouldn't even be there, but is as a result of an error.  I've reported for over a year.  For it to go this long without being addressed is negligence.  It seems unfair that someone is being fined for an error.  It's misleading.  I've tried talking to the Clerk and to the Legal Department.  The Clerk refuses to talk to me directly, and Legal has discussed this with Parking and has decided to uphold the ordinance concerning yellow curbs.    The space also falls under the ordinance for a designated parking space, so who is deciding which one to follow, when it falls under both, and is a mistake to begin with?  Legal told me that the line is ""faintly visible"".  I've included a picture of that line and the actual parking line next to it.  The actual parking line is more faded than the line that's a mistake.  All I have asked for is for the ticket to be waived and the white line painted black again.  I think this whole situation is ridiculous and able to be easily corrected.  I'm in management, and if there was confusion caused by my error, I would address it and fix it.  Can you please help me in this situation, or refer me to someone who can?

Thank you for your time.

Additionally, there are some bushes on the south end of the Subway building that block half of the sidewalk so that you can't see to pull out south on Woodlawn until the front of the car is already into the northbound lane, but more importantly, they block the view of pedestrians walking south until they are walking out into the alley and into the path of cars coming out of the alley onto Woodlawn.

Over the past few months, we have seen increase sizes of the existing potholes that were there probably from last winter or just erosion over time. This alley way is a gravel drive so as cars continue to drive on it, the potholes get bigger and deeper. I was seeing if there is a possibility before the winter to get the holes filled in with asphalt or gravel to prevent our sedans from bottoming out and scraping the ground with our cars. I know that this alley road is a popular road for the tenants that live within a few houses of the alley because it is one of the main access points to the parking lot in the back of the houses. I would appreciate if someone could reach out to me to even see if it is possible to accomplish before the first snow fall this year. I am available by phone or email to give more information or any questions.","Street Department","317 E 10th ST",Bloomington,IN,47408,39.17182922363281,-86.53040313720703

Our address is 5274 N Filbert Drive, Bloomington, 47404, our street name is N Filbert Dr.  

This is a safety and liability concern, if emergency vehicles – fire, ambulance, or police had to find one of the houses on our street, they would be unable to, especially since our street still doesn’t show up on Google maps.  The thought of something bad happening to a member my family or to me and knowing that help might not find us is very unsettling.
 
We’ve waited for 6 months and still no sign.  I'm not sure who to contact, and whether it is the city, the planning department, or the developer who is responsible for street signs, but I'm hoping you can help me figure out who I can contact - if it isn't your office.

Thanks!

I had recently fell victim to a pothole located on 580 E Rhorer Rd that resulted in a damaged Rim, Tire, and hubcap as far as I am able to tell at the moment. This resulted from a suggested detour due to construction being performed on West Country Club Dr. Due to this issue, I was attempting to reach out to the appropriate channel in hopes of seeking to file a claim to have the repair costs covered and get the pothole fixed before someone else gets seriously injured!

Please let me know how I should proceed or what measures I need to take in order to sort this matter.

My name is Lauren McDonald, and I live in one of the units on 1109 South Rogers in Bloomington. There is a water meter in my front yard and the cover was not properly/safely re-attached. This morning I was walking across the yard and stepped on the cover, and my entire leg fell into the water meter. My leg is scraped, swollen, and bruised because of it. I placed the cap back on the hole, but provided a photo below.

I spoke to Frank (unsure if his last name) about this issue on the phone, and they are planning to have it resolved. However, I did want it recorded that I was injured because of it. This could have seriously injured a child.

I was wondering if you could please confirm receipt and understanding that I was injured because of this.

Don't know if the city or party that dug it was looking for pipes or what, but the hole has been there for almost two weeks unfilled.  There are 6 parking spots all in a row behind the property.  The pothole is dug in such a way that it is directly behind a parking spot making the spot unusable.    

Also, when the pothole was initially dug there was already a car in the parking spot.  The pothole was dug directly behind the tires of the car making it impossible to avoid when the car backed out.  May want to instruct crews or whichever party was responsible not to do that.  Pothole should not be hard to spot.

Please let me know at the email address provided when to expect the pothole to be filled and if there is any other info you need

There is a ""traffic calming"" device at the west end of the intersection.  Another car just struct the curb with some damage today. Last Friday evening two cars struck the device. A week or so ago a Bloomington Police Car struct the curb and blew a tire.  This is a common occurrence day and night, on a daily basis. Recently a crew repainted the curb yellow and glued on reflectors. The reflectors were soon scrubbed off by cars hitting the curbs. The curb needs a visible warning at eye-level that drivers can see.  They obviously do not see the curb below their eye level.  The new yellow paint curb has been hit so many times it is already black with tire rubber.

Elliston Drive, and I believe that their might be an underground stream that has developed.  The road where it meets the curb continues to create little sink holes and the same is happening to my yard where it meets the curb of the street.  I have tried filling with soil, but it appears to get washed away.  I encourage any suggestions or help.

Over the past few years, the gutter from in front of our home (1504 E Elliston) on down to Fenway Pl has deteriorated significantly to the point that our driveway & yard are sinking as well. I'm no longer able to get my cars out of my driveway without scraping the bottom. When we get major rainstorms, I've noticed that the water runs directly into the ground from the gaps in the gutters & road, which I'd imagine contributes to the gutters & road sinking.

I appreciate that they were out there patching the holes, but the patching really is very temporary from my observation. I was wondering if the city would have any plans to shore up the foundation, perhaps rebuild the gutters in a way that my driveway/yard won't continue to sink. Your consideration would be greatly appreciated - thank you!","Street Department","1422 E Elliston DR",Bloomington,IN,47401,39.12990951538086,-86.51593017578125

I've already tripped at least once in the last few days when I've been out walking my dog.

I have no idea what purpose these tar strips serve as the road is in perfect condition.  (no cracks that I can see)  Just curious what problem this sticky solution was intended to solve.
Thanks, Mike","Street Department",,Bloomington,IN,,,

Hi,

This repair has not been made yet.  There are no indications that a utility locator service has marked the immediate area.  The cone disappeared a long time ago & school buses keep running over the storm inlet.  Was wondering when the repair might happen?  If the grate collapses, it's going to seriously damage a vehicle.

However, when the crossing sign was installed on this corner, the road was never filled back in. We're only into December, and this pothole is like a crater when riding a bike. Because it is right in-front of the crossing sign, one must go into the pothole in order to activate the button, and then it takes much longer to get out of the pothole and enter the intersection. It's taken me long enough at least two times that vehicles which had slowed to allow me to pass actually started progressing into the intersection again because I couldn't navigate out of the pothole quickly enough. This totally null-and-voids the enter purpose of the signal enough that I've temporarily stopped using it in daylight hours.
Even just a temporary fill or cover would be helpful until it can be repaved/sealed.

I don't think it has been repaved since the addition was built. The Street Department came some years ago when I requested they to come look at the street.  You/Street Department came right away and put down long stripes of paving which I really appreciated because it made our street really nice again.  But now, especially in front of the mailboxes, it is breaking up badly.  I know the Street Department can't do repair work in the cold weather we are expecting next week, but I'd like to be put on the list for pothole repair at the entrance as soon as possible and when spring/summer comes please look at our little street to see if you can once again put down some paving to cover the broken areas.

The storm sewers are often blocked and the culvert at the bottom of the park is inadequate to handle the water that runs off Ernest Butler Park. The whole situaiton is a mess and largely caused by City mismanagement. Additionally, the City has repeatedly allowed Mr. Goodman to violate City rules and codes and directives and his mess and non-running cars adds to the mix of this mess--once again a case of City mismanagement. This horrible situation has persisted for years. As the owner of 605 N Fairview I am seriously considering hiring an attorney and taking formal legal action against the City for its inattention to its own rules. If the Goodman property were a rental property that I owned I would be getting a complaint notice every other day.

I was going 15 mph since it is right by the stoplight at Jordan and Atwater and my back rear tire popped and the front passenger rim is completely bent. My car was undrivable and required roadside assistance to get it towed. I now need to have two tires, a rim and wheel replaced as well as a complete alignment done on my car. I am now left without a car for a week, I am forced to pay nearly $1000 in damages to my car and as a full time student who also works part time, this is a very large sum of money. The city needs to fix this quickly so that it does not happen to anybody else.","Street Department","Jordan & Atwater",Bloomington,IN,,39.16299438476562,-86.51634216308594
